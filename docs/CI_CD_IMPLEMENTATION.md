## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive CI/CD system that:

- ✅ Enforces all quality gates with automatic pass/fail decisions
- ✅ Implements hermetic boot verification with signed transcripts
- ✅ Executes V0-V3 evaluation matrix with statistical rigor
- ✅ Provides CI-backed promotion decisions using Bootstrap BCa + FDR
- ✅ Supports automated iteration on failed gates
- ✅ Enables zero-configuration setup from clean repository checkout

## Implementation Components

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Primary CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Building Phase**: Environment setup, asset fetching, contract compilation, static analysis, hermetic boot
- **Running Phase**: V0-V3 variant execution with complete evaluation matrix
- **Testing Phase**: Property/metamorphic tests, mutation testing, fuzzing
- **Tracking Phase**: Metrics aggregation, Bootstrap BCa analysis, FDR correction
- **Evaluating Phase**: Gatekeeper quality gate decisions
- **Refinement Phase**: Automated iteration on failed gates

#### Evaluation Matrix Workflow (`.github/workflows/evaluation-matrix.yml`)
- **Matrix Preparation**: Multi-variant, multi-round statistical evaluation
- **V0-V3 Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation with 5 rounds per variant
- **Statistical Analysis**: Bootstrap confidence intervals and FDR correction
- **Promotion Decisions**: Evidence-based deployment recommendations

### 2. Quality Gate System

#### Gatekeeper Decision Engine (`scripts/gatekeeper.py`)
```python
# Key features:
- 10 quality gates with weighted scoring
- Critical failure blocking (SAST, mutation, budget, determinism)
- Composite scoring with 85% promotion threshold
- Risk assessment integration
- Detailed recommendations for failures

# Decision outcomes:
- PROMOTE: All critical gates pass, score ≥ 85%
- AGENT_REFINE: Some gates fail, automated fixes possible
- MANUAL_QA: High risk or multiple critical failures
```

#### Quality Gate Configuration (`scripts/gates.yaml`)
```yaml
# Static Analysis Gates
sast_high_critical: 0 (critical)
mutation_score: ≥80% (critical) 
property_coverage: ≥70%
fuzz_crashes: 0 (critical)

# Determinism/Budget Gates
budget_overrun: 0 (critical)
budget_underrun: ≤0.5%
determinism_consistency: 3x identical (critical)

# Domain KPI Gates
token_efficiency_ci_lower: >0 vs V0 (critical)
latency_p50_overhead: ≤30%
latency_p95_overhead: ≤50%
```

### 3. Statistical Validation Framework

#### Bootstrap BCa Analysis (`scripts/bootstrap_bca.py`)
- Bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals
- 10,000 bootstrap iterations with fixed random seed (42)
- Token-efficiency analysis with CI lower bound > 0 requirement
- Comprehensive statistical properties reporting

#### FDR Correction (`scripts/fdr.py`)
- Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction
- Multiple comparison protection across V0-V3 variants
- Effect size analysis with Cohen's d classification
- Statistical significance thresholds with α = 0.05

### 4. Hermetic Build System

#### Container Infrastructure (`infra/Dockerfile`)
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage hermetic builds:
- Base: Python 3.12 + uv + security updates
- Development: Full toolchain + testing dependencies
- CI: Additional security scanners + static analysis
- Production: Minimal runtime with health checks
```

#### Hermetic Boot Verification (`scripts/spinup_smoke.sh`)
```bash
# Complete boot verification:
1. Environment validation (tools, Git, Docker)
2. Container build with reproducible layers
3. Dependency lock verification with SHA recording
4. Core functionality validation with imports
5. Golden smoke tests with deterministic output
6. Signed boot transcript generation
```

### 5. Evaluation Matrix System

```yaml
V0: Baseline (README + top-N BM25 files)
  - Simple ranking algorithm
  - Baseline performance metrics
  - Reference implementation

V1: Hardening (spec+oracles)
  - Runtime oracles and contract validation
  - Budget enforcement and determinism checks
  - Improved error handling and validation

V2: Coverage construction (k-means + HNSW medoids)

  - Coverage optimization with centroids
  - Performance vs quality trade-offs

V3: Demotion stability controller
  - Bounded re-optimization to prevent oscillations
  - Stability metrics and demotion event tracking
  - Controller-based system management
```

#### Statistical Evaluation Framework
```python
# Multi-round evaluation with statistical rigor:
- 5 evaluation rounds per variant for statistical power
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for all metrics
- FDR correction for multiple comparisons
- Effect size analysis for practical significance
- Promotion decisions based on CI lower bounds
```

### 6. Promotion Management System

#### Promotion Manager (`scripts/promote.py`)
- Artifact collection and packaging
- Deployment configuration generation
- Rollback mechanism setup
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Promotion documentation and reporting

#### Deployment Configurations
```yaml
# Generated deployment configs:
- Container resource limits based on performance gates
- Auto-scaling parameters from load testing
- Health check endpoints with SLA monitoring  
- Rollback triggers and procedures
- Monitoring dashboards and alerting rules
```
