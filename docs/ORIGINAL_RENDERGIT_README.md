# rendergit (Original Tool README)

> Just show me the code.

Tired of clicking around complex file hierarchies of GitHub repos? Do you just want to see all of the code on a single page? Enter `rendergit`. Flatten any GitHub repository into a single, static HTML page with syntax highlighting, markdown rendering, and a clean sidebar navigation. Perfect for code review, exploration, and an instant Ctrl+F experience.

## Basic usage

Install and use easily with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/karpathy/rendergit
rendergit https://github.com/karpathy/nanogpt
```

Alternatively, more manual pip install example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karpathy/rendergit
cd rendergit
pip install -e .
rendergit https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT
```

The code will:
1. Clone the repo to a temporary directory
2. Render its source code into a single static temporary HTML file
3. Automatically open the file in your browser

Once open, you can toggle between two views:
- **ðŸ‘¤ Human View**: Browse with syntax highlighting, sidebar navigation, visual goodies
- **ðŸ¤– LLM View**: Copy the entire codebase as CXML text to paste into Claude, ChatGPT, etc.

There's a few other smaller options, see the code.

## Features

- **Dual view modes** - toggle between Human and LLM views
  - **ðŸ‘¤ Human View**: Pretty interface with syntax highlighting and navigation
  - **ðŸ¤– LLM View**: Raw CXML text format - perfect for copying to Claude/ChatGPT for code analysis
- **Syntax highlighting** for code files via Pygments
- **Markdown rendering** for README files and docs
- **Smart filtering** - skips binaries and oversized files
- **Directory tree** overview at the top
- **Sidebar navigation** with file links and sizes
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile
- **Search-friendly** - use Ctrl+F to find anything across all files

## Repository Structure

This repository contains both the main `rendergit` tool and the integrated `PackRepo` research system:

- **`rendergit.py`** - Main application for rendering GitHub repos to HTML
- **`packrepo/`** - Sophisticated repository packing system with LLM optimization
- **`research/`** - Academic research components (benchmarks, evaluation, statistical analysis)
- **`tools/`** - Development utilities (demo, debug, runner scripts)
- **`docs/`** - Documentation and research papers
- **`tests/`** - Comprehensive test suite
- **`results/`** - Generated analysis outputs and artifacts

See individual directory README files for more details on each component.

## Contributing

I vibe coded this utility a few months ago but I keep using it very often so I figured I'd just share it. I don't super intend to maintain or support it though.
