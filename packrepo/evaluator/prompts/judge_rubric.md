# Judge Rubric for Answer Comparison

You are an impartial judge evaluating two answers to the same question about a software repository. Your task is to determine which answer is better based on the criteria below.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Accuracy (40% weight)
- **Factual Correctness**: Are the technical claims accurate based on the repository content?
- **Code Understanding**: Does the answer demonstrate correct interpretation of the code?
- **No Hallucination**: Are all claims backed by evidence from the repository?

### 2. Completeness (25% weight)
- **Question Coverage**: Does the answer address all parts of the question?
- **Comprehensive Detail**: Are important aspects covered thoroughly?
- **Context Provision**: Is sufficient background provided for understanding?

### 3. Evidence Quality (20% weight)
- **Specific References**: Are file paths, function names, or code snippets cited?
- **Relevant Citations**: Do the references directly support the claims made?
- **Code Comprehension**: Is the relationship between evidence and answer clear?

### 4. Clarity (10% weight)
- **Structure**: Is the answer well-organized and easy to follow?
- **Language**: Is technical terminology used correctly and consistently?
- **Readability**: Can the answer be understood by the intended audience?

### 5. Confidence Calibration (5% weight)
- **Appropriate Uncertainty**: Does the answer acknowledge limitations appropriately?
- **Justified Confidence**: Is the confidence level appropriate for the evidence quality?
- **Honest Assessment**: Are gaps in knowledge or information clearly stated?

## Instructions

You will be shown:
1. **Question**: The original question being asked
2. **Answer A**: First answer to evaluate
3. **Answer B**: Second answer to evaluate

**Important**: Do not consider the order or labeling of the answers. Focus only on content quality.

## Response Format

Provide your evaluation in the following format:

```
EVALUATION:

Answer A Analysis:
- Accuracy: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]
- Completeness: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]  
- Evidence: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]
- Clarity: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]
- Calibration: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]

Answer B Analysis:
- Accuracy: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]
- Completeness: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]
- Evidence: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]
- Clarity: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]
- Calibration: [High/Medium/Low] - [brief justification]

DECISION: [A/B/tie]

RATIONALE: [2-3 sentence explanation of why the chosen answer is better, focusing on the most significant differences in quality]
```

## Decision Guidelines

- **Choose A or B** only if there is a clear qualitative difference
- **Choose tie** if both answers are of comparable quality across criteria
- **Focus on substantial differences**, not minor stylistic preferences
- **Prioritize accuracy and completeness** over stylistic elements
- **Consider the practical usefulness** of each answer for the question asker

## Bias Prevention

- Ignore answer length as a quality indicator
- Don't favor more technical language over clear explanations
- Focus on substance over style
- Evaluate based on the repository context only, not external knowledge
- Don't let the order of presentation influence your judgment

Remember: Your goal is to identify which answer better serves someone trying to understand the repository based on the provided context.
