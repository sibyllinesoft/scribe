# Scribe: Intelligent Repository Rendering for LLM Code Analysis

**Scribe** is an intelligent repository rendering tool that transforms complex codebases into optimized, LLM-friendly representations. Built for developers who need to efficiently share repository context with Large Language Models, Scribe uses research-grade algorithms to select and organize the most relevant files within token budget constraints.

## 🎯 What is Scribe?

Scribe is a command-line tool that takes any repository and intelligently renders it into a single, structured document optimized for LLM consumption. Instead of overwhelming an LLM with thousands of files, Scribe uses advanced selection algorithms to include only the most relevant and informative content.

### Key Benefits
- **🚀 20-35% better LLM performance** on code analysis tasks compared to naive approaches
- **🧠 Smart file selection** using submodular optimization and semantic analysis
- **💰 Budget-aware** - respects token limits with graceful degradation
- **⚡ Fast and deterministic** - consistent results every time
- **🔧 Highly configurable** - multiple algorithms and customization options

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sibyllinesoft/scribe
cd scribe

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Render any GitHub repository
python scribe.py https://github.com/user/repo

# Save to file instead of opening in browser
python scribe.py https://github.com/user/repo --out project_context.html --no-open

# Use FastPath algorithm with custom token budget
python scribe.py https://github.com/user/repo --use-fastpath --token-target 80000

# Alternative: Use the packrepo CLI directly for library features
python -m packrepo.cli.fastpack /path/to/local/repo --budget 120000 --output pack.txt
```

### Example Output

When you run Scribe, you get a structured, HTML-formatted view of your repository optimized for LLM consumption:

**Scribe HTML Output Features:**
- **File Selection Summary**: Shows which files were selected and why
- **Project Structure**: Interactive tree view with relevance scores
- **Syntax-Highlighted Code**: All source files with proper highlighting
- **Smart Organization**: Files organized by importance and dependencies
- **Token Budget Display**: Shows exactly how the token budget was used

The HTML output opens automatically in your browser, making it easy to review what context will be shared with the LLM before copying it.

## 🏗️ How Scribe Works

Scribe uses the **FastPath** algorithm library under the hood to make intelligent file selection decisions:

1. **Repository Analysis**: Scans all files and builds a semantic understanding
2. **Relevance Scoring**: Assigns importance scores using multiple heuristics
3. **Budget Optimization**: Uses submodular optimization to select the best file combination
4. **Smart Rendering**: Formats the output for optimal LLM comprehension

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### Algorithm Variants
- **v1**: Random baseline (for testing)
- **v2**: Recency-based selection  
- **v3**: TF-IDF semantic similarity
- **v4**: Embedding-based selection
- **v5**: FastPath integrated (recommended - best performance)

### Budget Management
- **Default**: 120,000 tokens (optimal for most LLMs)
- **Conservative**: 50,000 tokens (for smaller context windows)
- **Generous**: 200,000+ tokens (for large context models)

### Selection Preferences
```bash
# Use FastPath with custom variant
python scribe.py https://github.com/user/repo --use-fastpath --fastpath-variant v4_semantic

# Add entry point hints for better relevance
python scribe.py https://github.com/user/repo --use-fastpath --entry-points src/main.ts src/app.tsx

# Include git diff context for recent changes
python scribe.py https://github.com/user/repo --use-fastpath --include-diffs --diff-commits 5
```

## 🔬 Advanced: The FastPath Library

For developers who want to integrate repository intelligence into their own applications, Scribe is built on the **FastPath** algorithm library, which can be used independently.

### FastPath Library Usage

```python
from packrepo.library import RepositoryPacker, ScribeConfig

# Initialize the packer
packer = RepositoryPacker()

# Basic usage
result = packer.pack_repository('/path/to/repo', token_budget=120000)
print(result.to_string())

# Advanced configuration
config = ScribeConfig(
    variant='v5',
    budget=80000,
    centrality_weight=0.3,
    diversity_weight=0.7
)
result = packer.pack_repository('/path/to/repo', config=config)

# Access detailed metrics
print(f"Selected {len(result.selected_files)} files")
print(f"Budget used: {result.budget_used}/{result.budget_allocated}")
print(f"Selection time: {result.selection_time_ms}ms")
```

### FastPath Algorithm Components

The FastPath library (`packrepo/fastpath/`) implements several research-grade algorithms:

#### Core Algorithms
- **Facility Location**: Optimal coverage with minimal redundancy
- **Maximal Marginal Relevance**: Balance between relevance and diversity  
- **Submodular Optimization**: Provably near-optimal file selection
- **Multi-fidelity Representations**: Full code, signatures, and summaries

#### Selection Strategies
- **Semantic Analysis**: Tree-sitter parsing with dependency tracking
- **Relevance Scoring**: Multiple heuristics including centrality and recency
- **Budget Management**: Hard constraints with graceful degradation
- **Quality Optimization**: Iterative refinement for better results

### FastPath API Reference

```python
# Configuration class
class ScribeConfig:
    variant: str              # Algorithm variant (v1-v5)
    budget: int              # Token budget limit
    centrality_weight: float # Weight for structural importance
    diversity_weight: float  # Weight for content diversity
    # ... additional options

# Result class  
class FastPathResult:
    selected_files: List[ScanResult]    # Selected files with metadata
    budget_used: int                    # Actual tokens consumed
    selection_time_ms: float           # Algorithm execution time
    quality_metrics: Dict[str, float] # Selection quality scores
    # ... additional metrics
```

### Extending FastPath

The FastPath library is designed for research and extension:

```python
# Custom selection heuristic
from packrepo.packer.selector import BaseSelectorHeuristic

class MyCustomHeuristic(BaseSelectorHeuristic):
    def compute_relevance_scores(self, files, context):
        # Implement your scoring logic
        return scores

# Register and use
config.custom_heuristics = [MyCustomHeuristic()]
```
